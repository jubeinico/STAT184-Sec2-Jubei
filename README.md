 STAT184 Github Day 1 HW Template
#Introduction
The goal of the assignment was to optimize a box's volume using R. The results were then graphed.
#Implementation
Variables were assigned to length and width, and a function was assigned to volume for possible values for height. The values for height were graphed to find the value that resulted in the maxmimum volume. 
#Results
The maximum height for an 8.5 x 11 sheet of paper folded into a box was around 1.7-- the graph is below.

The assignment illustrated how to create and utilize functions as well as simple plots.
